Solid Earth,https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/ssm,soil moisture,"Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) is the relative water content of the top few centimetres soil, describing how wet or dry the soil is in its topmost layer, expressed in percent saturation. It is measured by satellite radar sensors and allows insights in local precipitation impacts and soil conditions.
SSM is a key driver of water and heat fluxes between the ground and the atmosphere, regulating air temperature and humidity. Moreover, in its role as water supply, it is vital to vegetation health. Vice versa, SSM is very sensitive to external forcing in the form of precipitation, temperature, solar irradiation, humidity, and wind. SSM is thus both an integrator of climatic conditions and a driver of local weather and climate, and plays a major role in global water-, energy- and carbon- cycles.
Knowledge on the dynamics of soil moisture is important in the understanding of processes in many environmental and socio-economic fields, e.g., its impact on vegetation vitality, crop yield, droughts or exposure to flood threats. Soil Moisture is recognized as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS).

Atmosphere,https://4dhydro.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/proposal_4dhydro.pdf,evapotranspiration ,"UFZ will collect the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space
Station (ECOSTRESS) product, the MODIS global evapotranspiration product and other datasets gen-
erated for this project using the HOLAPS, ALEXI and DisALEXI models. Lower resolution products
widely used in the literature, like the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) product, will
be collected for comparison purposes. Additionally, evapotranspiration measurements from eddy covariance
sites will be collected from different databases [48] for the validation and evaluation of EO products."
Solid Earth,https://4dhydro.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/proposal_4dhydro.pdf,precipitation,"CNR-IRPI will capitalize on activities carried out in previous and current ESA projects (SMOS
+ Rainfall, DTE Hydrology, 4DMED-Hydrology) to develop a high-resolution (1 km , daily) precipitation product
throughout Europe. The product will integrate two SM2RAIN-based (Soil Moisture to RAIN,) products
applied to Sentinel-1 and ASCAT soil moisture products with GPM late Run satellite products, bearing
in mind the limitations of satellite soil moisture products over mountain areas and over snow/frozen soils.
Therefore, the high-resolution (1 km , 1 day) rainfall product, based on EO data, will be developed and tested
in the hydrological applications."

and related ESA Surface2Storage project. Within these projects high-resolution EO data is used to quantify
surface water extent, level and volume, by combining data from sensors that can capture these types of dy-
namics (e.g., Sentinel-2 for surface water extent, ICESat-2 for water levels), enhanced by in-situ measurements
when available. The combination with hydrological models enables a detailed assessment of reservoir inflow
and outflow, which in the case of large reservoirs is a critical component of the downstream flow regime. This
data can additionally be used for calibration and/or validation of the models, which is also the case for the
river levels and discharge data that are also part of this task. In-situ measurements of this kind will be collected
for all study areas and supported by EO datasets"

is exploring, developing and validating advanced Earth Observation-based algorithms and techniques for
irrigation mapping, quantification and detection of seasonal timing of irrigation from field to regional/global
scale. The project capitalizes on the advent of the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel missions in synergy
with other data types and models. In 4DHydro the results of Irrigation+, and particularly the regional products
available at 1 km resolution for the Po and Ebro river basins [38, 54, 55]. Indeed, the accuracy of the irrigation
water product needs to be carefully checked before its use in large scale hydrological modelling. If successful,
the integration of Irrigation+ and 4DHydro project results will constitute a ground-breaking result both in
terms of scientific achievements and also for the operational management of water resources"
land,https://4dhydro.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/proposal_4dhydro.pdf,total water storage ,"TUW will collect the satellite-based groundwater storage variations data generated within the H2020 project Global Gravity-based Groundwater Product (G3P, ht
tps://www.g3p.eu/). A preliminary groundwater product shall be released by the end 2022. Along with the
EO groundwater dataset, we will collect in-situ measurements of groundwater levels obtained from the In-
ternational Groundwater Resources Assessment Centre (IGRAC, https://www.un-igrac.org/) and other site-
specific measurements when available. Simultaneously, we will collect total water storage variation retrieved
from GRACE, specifically the COST-G (International Combination Service for Time-variable Gravity Fields) prod-
uct. It should be noted both remotely sensed products of groundwater storage and total water variations are
only available at coarse spatial resolution."

Oceans,https://4dhydro.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/proposal_4dhydro.pdf,mask,"CSGROUP has been in charge producing surface water masks at 10m resolution using either Sentinel 1 radar images, Sentinel 2 optical images or a combination of both. On Sentinel
2 images clouds can be masked or removed using the MAJA algorithm [52, 53]. Single masks (at observation
time) or monthly mean water masks (to reduced uncertainty) can be produced by this chain. In 4DHydro ,
CSGROUP – France proposes to produce dynamic water masks for the four study regions. These masks will
be computed using the Surfwater toolchain and eventually using other dedicated tools used by the French scientific community. In that case, CSGROUP – France will merge the products and whenever it is possible
produce the corresponding uncertainty maps. Moreover, CSGROUP – France will also gather existing open
datasets of dynamic surface water masks, such as The Landsat Collection 2 (C2) Level-3 Dynamic Surface Water
Extent (DSWE) or dynamic water masks produced by our partners."
