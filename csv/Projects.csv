ONGOING,"Hyper-resolution Earth observations and
land-surface modeling for a better
understanding of the water cycle",4dHydro,"The overarching objective of 4DHydro is to foster collaborations between the Earth Observation (EO) water cycle community developing novel high-resolution EO data products, and the land surface and hydrological modelling community (LSM/HM) engaged in advancing hyperresolution modelling of the hydrological cycle at regional and continental scales. By involving several European institutions 4DHydro will assess and improve data sets of EO as well as synchronize EO products and LSM/HM models in order to improve predictions of the hydrological system",https://4dhydro.eu,"Helmholtz - Zentrum Fuer Umweltforschung GmbH - UFZ,National Research Council of Italy-IRPI,CSGROUP,CzechGlobe,Deltares,Forschungszentrum Juelich GmbH,Vienna University of Technology,UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH),University of Trento,Universitat Politècnica de València, Utrecht University",2023-06-26,2024-12-12,Luis Samaniego,luis.samaniego@ufz.de
