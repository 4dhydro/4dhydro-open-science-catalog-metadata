Solid Earth,"Solid Earth refers to the crust, mantle and core. Because these parts of our world are completely hidden from view, understanding what is going on deep below our feet can only be done by using indirect measurements.","",./EO_Solid_Earth.webp
land,"A specified geographical tract of the Earth's surface including all its attributes, comprising its geology, superficial deposits, topography, hydrology, soils, flora and fauna, together with the results of past and present human activity, to the extent that these attributes exert a significant influence on the present and future land utilization.

Oceans,"Ocean is defined as the mass of water occupying all of the Earth's surface not occupied by land, but excluding all lakes and inland seas. Covering some 70% of the Earthss surface, the ocean is a major driver of the world's weather and climate. It also plays a central role in climate change. The ocean is also a major driver of the global economy, carrying more than 90% of world trade and sustaining the 40% of humanity that lives within 100 km of the coast. Today, the growing impacts of climate change are making ocean observations, research and services more critical than ever before (source: https://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/en/concept/5789; https://public.wmo.int/en/our-mandate/focus-areas/oceans).",,./EO_Oceans.webp
Atmosphere,"The gaseous envelope surrounding the Earth in a several kilometers-thick layer. The atmosphere is a gaseous envelope surrounding and protecting our planet from the intense radiation of the Sun and serves as a key interface between the terrestrial and ocean cycles. Although it only extends a few hundred kilometers above the surface, it contains a mixture of gases, such as oxygen and nitrogen, that are critical for life to exist. It distributes incoming solar radiation, protecting life from harmful ultraviolet radiation but also driving atmospheric circulation and weather. The atmosphere enables the greenhouse effect, which makes Earth more habitable. Human activity, however, is contributing more gases, many of which are negatively impacting the protective nature of this vital layer.

Magnetosphere_Ionosphere,"The magnetosphere is the region of space surrounding Earth where the dominant magnetic field is the magnetic field of Earth, rather than the magnetic field of interplanetary space. The magnetosphere is formed by the interaction of the solar wind with Earth's magnetic field. The Ionosphere is a region of the earth's atmosphere, extending from about 60 to 1000 kilometers above the Earth's surface, in which there is a high concentration of free electrons formed as a result of ionizing radiation entering the atmosphere from space. The ionosphere is important because it reflects and modifies radio waves used for communication and navigation. Other phenomena such as energetic charged particles and cosmic rays also have an ionizing effect and can contribute to the ionosphere.
