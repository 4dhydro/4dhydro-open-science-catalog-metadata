The two products are merged with a triple collocation technique (third product: ERA5 Land precipitation). Prior the merging the data are downscaled at 1 km spatial resolution using CHELSA (1 km) climatology. The merging technique allows to obtain a high-resolution product (1km-24 hour) over Tugela basin.

The two products are merged with a triple collocation technique (third product: ERA5 Land precipitation). Prior the merging the data are downscaled at 1 km spatial resolution using CHELSA (1 km) climatology. The merging technique allows to obtain a high-resolution product (1km-24 hour) over Tugela basin.

The two products are merged with a triple collocation technique (third product: ERA5 Land precipitation). Prior the merging the data are downscaled at 1 km spatial resolution using CHELSA (1 km) climatology. The merging technique allows to obtain a high-resolution product (1km-24 hour) over Tugela basin.
