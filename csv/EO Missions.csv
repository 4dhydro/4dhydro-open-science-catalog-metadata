"TERRA", The Terra (formerly called EOS AM-1) satellite is the flagship of NASA's Earth Science Missions. Terra is the first EOS (Earth Observing System) platform and provides global data on the state of the atmosphere, land, and oceans, as well as their interactions with solar radiation and with one another., https://eospso.nasa.gov/missions/terra
"AQUA",Aqua is a major international Earth Science satellite mission centered at NASA. Launched on May 4, 2002, the satellite has six differrent Earth-observing instruments on board and is named for the large amount of information it collects about water in the Earth system.,https://eospso.nasa.gov/missions/aqua
"Sentinel-2 MSI", A constellation of two identical satellites in the same orbit, Copernicus Sentinel-2 images land and coastal areas at high spatial resolution in the optical domain. The MultiSpectral Instrument measures the Earth's reflected radiance in 13 spectral bands from VNIR to SWIR, https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/copernicus/sentinel-2
"Sentinel-1 SAR", A high-res radar imagery satellite, providing an all-weather, day-and-night supply of images of Earth’s surface, https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/copernicus/sentinel-1
"Sentinel-3 OLCI", Sentinel-3 measures systematically Earth’s oceans, land, rivers and lakes, land ice, sea-ice and atmosphere, to monitor and understand long term and large-scale global dynamics, https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/copernicus/sentinel-3
"Landsat-8", he Landsat 8 satellite payload consists of two science instruments—the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). These two sensors provide seasonal coverage of the global landmass at a spatial resolution of 30 meters (visible, NIR, SWIR); 100 meters (thermal); and 15 meters (panchromatic)., https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellites/landsat-8/
