TERRA," The Terra (formerly called EOS AM-1) satellite is the flagship of NASA's Earth Science Missions. Terra is the first EOS (Earth Observing System) platform and provides global data on the state of the atmosphere, land, and oceans,  as well as their interactions with solar radiation and with one another.", https://eospso.nasa.gov/missions/terra
AQUA,"Aqua is a major international Earth Science satellite mission centered at NASA. Launched on May 4, 2002, the satellite has six differrent Earth-observing instruments on board and is named for the large amount of information it collects about water in the Earth system.",https://eospso.nasa.gov/missions/aqua
SMAP,Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) is a NASA mission with the primary aim of quantifying the amount of water in the surface soil using using microwave frequency radiometric measurements.,https://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/
SMOS,"Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) is one of the European Space Agency's Earth Explorer missions, providing microwave L-band measurements linked to global variability in soil moisture.",https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/smos
Sentinel-1,"ESA’s Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission carries out continuous radar measurements of the Earth’s surface, from which variables of importance to the hydrological cycle like surface soil moisture can be quantified.",https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-1
GRACE,The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (and Follow-on) mission developed by NASA and the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) provide information on the amount of water stored on land though measurements of the Earth’s gravity field.,https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/grace-fo/
